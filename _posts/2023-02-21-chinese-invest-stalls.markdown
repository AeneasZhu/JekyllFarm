<bold>Recovery hopes wane after property sales, cargo shipments prove disappointing</bold>

HONG KONG -- Foreign investors are scaling back their purchases of Chinese stocks as hopes for a reopening rally in the world's second-biggest economy give way to concerns about falling cargo shipments and lackluster sales of homes and cars.

After jumping 18.47% in the three months ending in January, the widely followed CSI 300 equities index has slipped 2.94% in February to 4034.51, with foreign purchases of Chinese stocks via the trading link between Hong Kong and the mainland slowing significantly.

So far in February, foreign investors have bought a net 16.6 billion yuan ($2.41 billion) in mainland stocks using the trading link, down from 89.1 billion yuan in the same period last month and a record 141.2 billion yuan for all of January, according to data provider Wind. There has been an outflow of foreign investment in six of the 13 trading days in February, compared with only one net negative day in January.

"The initial reopening sort of frenzy is mostly behind us now," said Carlos Casanova, Hong Kong-based senior Asia economist for UBP, a Swiss private bank.  

The CSI 300 had bounced from a 2022 low of 3508.7 at the end of October, with much of the advance coming after Beijing reversed its zero-COVID-19 policies in December.

However, even during the rally, many foreign investors remained unenthusiastic. Robert Buckland, chief global equity strategist at Citi Investment Research, suggested during a January webinar in Singapore that it was possible the Chinese market could be changing from being "completely uninvestable" to a "troubled asset class."

Such concerns have been buttressed more recently by uninspiring data from China's property market, ports and electric-vehicle makers; rising interest rates in the U.S.; and heightened geopolitical tensions after the U.S. shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon.

Maggie Wei at Goldman Sachs Asia said in a note this month that the most pressing concern for clients trying to estimate the magnitude of the Chinese economic rebound remains the state of its property market, which is strongly associated with consumer demand.

"Without the stabilization or rebound of the property sector," Wei said, investors are wondering "whether relaxation of COVID controls alone could generate high single-digit year-over-year growth in household consumption."

January's property sales figures were hardly encouraging. State-owned entities like Poly Development and Holdings Group and China Resources Land registered year-on-year growth in contracted sales of over 4%, but most private developers reported double-digit declines, with sales falling 41% at CIFI Holdings Group, 39% at China SCE Group Holdings and 71% at Guangzhou R&F Properties.

Kelly Chen, a real estate analyst at Moody's Investors Service, predicted that more small developers will default this year as policy support mainly benefits state-owned and top-tier private developers. She said the credit agency is "not expecting a V-shaped recovery" in the sector this year.

There is "almost no improvement on the local property market," according to a research note published on Jan. 31 by Chinese brokerage CLSA, which sent 32 analysts to 24 Chinese cities last month to talk with real estate agents and potential homebuyers. "The property market still appears to be in a trough, as potential homebuyers are holding strongly to a wait-and-see attitude."

Auto sales were hit in January as the government phased out incentives for purchases of EVs and traditional cars. BYD was the only major listed manufacturer that reported year-on-year sales growth last month. SAIC Motors, Guangzhou Automobile Group, Dongfeng Motor Group, Great Wall Motor and Geely Automobile Holdings all said overall sales and those of EVs fell by double digits.

"While sentiment bodes well for consumption, there won't be a material improvement in auto demand, in our view," said S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Claire Yuan.

The lifting of COVID restrictions has encouraged more people to travel, but cargo shipments have been slackening. While China Merchants Port Group recorded 31% growth in cargo throughputs in its domestic ports in January compared with a year ago, Cosco Shipping Ports saw the same figure drop by 12%. Guangzhou Port reported a 10% fall and Ningbo Zhoushan Port a 3% drop.

It was a similar story for air cargo. China Southern Airlines saw a year-on-year drop of 14% in January, while its two major state-owned peers carried over 40% less air cargo in terms of tonnage. In January, Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport handled 128.4 thousand tons of cargo, down 31% from a year ago, while it managed over 4.1 million passengers, up 36% year on year.

Casanova of UBP predicted that foreign investors are likely to sit on the fence until Beijing sets economic growth targets in March. Although he is optimistic that China's GDP will be boosted by rising consumption, he warned of potential market swings in both March and April as companies report fourth-quarter results weighed by the lockdowns.

Winnie Wu, managing director and co-head of China equity research at Bank of America, said investors would be looking carefully at corporate performance for signs that the Chinese rally might have a second leg.

Wu said June could be a key moment of truth for the Chinese economy, as it marks the first anniversary of the Shanghai lockdown. If there are signs of weakness in consumer confidence, credit demand, and manufacturing, "The Chinese government will face a harder decision of 'what do we stimulate now.'"
